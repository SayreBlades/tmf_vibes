## Support of polymorphism and extension patterns

Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.

Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).

The `@type` attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The `@type` gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a `@type` attributes that can be provided when this is useful.

The `@referredType` can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the `@type`, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, `@type` is generally not useful in reference objects.

The `@schemaLocation` property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.

The `@baseType` attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended.

## RESOURCE MODEL

### Managed Entity and Task Resource Models

#### GeographicAddressValidation resource

This resource is used to manage address validation request and response.

##### Resource model

[Figure: UML diagram showing relationships between GeographicAddressValidation, TaskStateType, AlternateGeographicAddressValidation, and GeographicAddress. GeographicAddressValidation has attributes like href, id, provideAlternative, state, validationDate, validationResult and can link to 0..* AlternateGeographicAddressValidation (alternateGeographicAddress), 0..1 GeographicAddress (validGeographicAddress), and 0..1 GeographicAddress (submittedGeographicAddress). TaskStateType is an enumeration with values acknowledged, inProgress, rejected, terminatedWithError, cancelled, done. AlternateGeographicAddressValidation and GeographicAddress share similar address fields (city, country, postcode, streetName, streetNr, etc.) and structure, but AlternateGeographicAddressValidation includes additional matching-related fields (matchinRule, matchingDegree, similarityScore). The diagram includes a legend indicating Resource (entry point), Sub-resource with details in separate diagram, Enumeration, and Mandatory property.]

[Figure: UML diagram depicting the GeographicSiteFeature structure (Figure 2). It shows the Feature entity (with discriminator GeographicSiteFeature) linked to PolicyRef (policyConstraint), Note (note), Characteristic (featureCharacteristic), RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef (relatedParty), CalendarPeriod (validFor), AttachmentRefOrValue (attachment), and FeatureRelationship (featureRelationship). FeatureRelationship links back to Feature. Characteristic is linked to CharacteristicRelationship. RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef is linked to PartyRefOrPartyRoleRef (discriminating between PartyRef and PartyRoleRef). CalendarPeriod is linked to HourPeriod. AttachmentRefOrValue discriminates between Attachment and AttachmentRef. PartyRefOrPartyRoleRef discriminates between PartyRef and PartyRoleRef. The diagram includes a legend for Sub-resource (sub-graph in current diagram), Sub-resource, Sub-resource (reference entity), and Mandatory property.]

[Figure: UML diagram illustrating PlaceRefOrValue (Figure 3). PlaceRefOrValue acts as a discriminator for various Place types including GeoJson types, AlternateGeographicAddressValidation, GeographicAddress, GeographicLocation, GeographicSite, PlaceRef, and Place. The diagram shows relationships from GeographicSite to PlaceRefOrValue (place), GeographicSiteRelationship (siteRelationship), CalendarPeriod (calendar), ContactMedium (contactMedium), RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef (relatedParty), GeographicSiteFeature (siteFeature), ExternalIdentifier (externalIdentifier), and bbox. GeographicSiteFeature is detailed in Figure 2. RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef links to PartyRefOrPartyRoleRef. GeographicLocation also acts as a discriminator for GeoJson point/line/polygon types. The diagram includes a legend for Sub-resource (sub-graph in current diagram), Sub-resource, Sub-resource (reference entity), Sub-resource with details in separate diagram, and Mandatory property.]

#### GeographicAddress resource

Structured textual way of describing how to find a Property in an urban area (country properties are often defined differently).
Note: Address corresponds to SID UrbanPropertyAddress.

##### Resource model

[Figure: UML diagram illustrating the GeographicAddress resource (Figure 4). GeographicAddress has attributes like city, country, postcode, streetName, etc. and relationships to GeographicAddressRelationship (0..*), GeographicSubAddress (0..*), StandardIdentifier (countryCode, 0..*), GeographicLocationRefOrValue (geographicLocation, 0..1), GeographicSiteRefOrValue (geographicSite, 0..1), and ExternalIdentifier (0..*). GeographicSubAddress has its own structure including a link to GeographicSubAddressUnit (0..*). Place acts as a discriminator including GeographicAddress. GeographicLocationRefOrValue and GeographicSiteRefOrValue act as discriminators for their respective Ref and Value types (including GeoJson and GeographicSite). GeographicSite has its own detailed structure including links to CalendarPeriod, ContactMedium, PlaceRefOrValue, RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef, GeographicSiteFeature, GeographicSiteRelationship, ExternalIdentifier, and bbox. The diagram includes a legend indicating Resource (entry point), Sub-resource, Sub-resource (reference entity), Sub-resource with details in separate diagram, and Mandatory property.]

[Figure: UML diagram depicting the GeographicSiteFeature structure (Figure 5), identical to Figure 2 on page 8. It shows the Feature entity (with discriminator GeographicSiteFeature) linked to PolicyRef (policyConstraint), Note (note), Characteristic (featureCharacteristic), RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef (relatedParty), CalendarPeriod (validFor), AttachmentRefOrValue (attachment), and FeatureRelationship (featureRelationship). FeatureRelationship links back to Feature. Characteristic is linked to CharacteristicRelationship. RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef is linked to PartyRefOrPartyRoleRef. CalendarPeriod is linked to HourPeriod. AttachmentRefOrValue discriminates between Attachment and AttachmentRef. PartyRefOrPartyRoleRef discriminates between PartyRef and PartyRoleRef. The diagram includes a legend for Sub-resource (sub-graph in current diagram), Sub-resource, Sub-resource (reference entity), and Mandatory property.]

*   **countryCode**
    *   A StandardIdentifier. The corresponding identification of the resource in different standard, regulatory definitions. The standard specification identifier (e.g., ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2) and the corresponding value (e.g., BE) relevant to a particular resource. It is anticipated that multiple standards can provide definitions for a single entity, e.g., a country identifier can be specified in various standards (e.g., "ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2", "ISO 3166-1 Alpha 3", "ISO 3166-1 Numeric").
*   **externalIdentifier**
    *   An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned by or originates in a software system different from the current system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.
*   **geographicAddressRelationship**

    *   A GeographicSiteRefOrValue. The polymorphic attributes `@type`, `@schemaLocation` & `@referredType` are related to the GeographicSite entity and not the GeographicSiteRefOrValue class itself.
*   **geographicSubAddress**
    *   A GeographicSubAddress. Representation of a GeographicSubAddress It is used for addressing within a property in an urban area (country properties are often defined differently). It may refer to a building, a building cluster, or a floor of a multistory building.
*   **href**
    *   A String. Hyperlink reference.
*   **id**
    *   A String. Unique identifier.
*   **locality**
    *   A String. An area of defined or undefined boundaries within a local authority or other legislatively defined area, usually rural or semi rural in nature. [ANZLIC-STREET], or a suburb, a bounded locality within a city, town or shire principally of urban character [ANZLICSTREET].

*   **externalIdentifier**
    *   An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned by or originates in a software system different from the current system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

### Notification Resource Models

4 notifications are defined for this API.

Notifications related to GeographicAddressValidation:

*   State Change Event

Notifications related to GeographicAddress:

*   Create Event
*   Delete Event
*   Attribute Value Change Event

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

[Figure: UML diagram showing the Notification Pattern (Figure 11). An Event object (with attributes correlationId, description, domain, eventId, eventTime, eventType, fieldPath, href, id, priority, timeOccurred, title) is linked to a SpecificEvent (1). SpecificEvent is linked to a SpecificEventPayload (1, event). SpecificEventPayload is linked to a SpecificResource (1, resourceName).]

#### Updates partially a GeographicAddress

`PATCH /geographicAddress/{id}?fields=...`

##### Description

This operation allows partial updates of a GeographicAddress entity. Support of json/merge (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

## API NOTIFICATIONS

For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST calls.

It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines reproduced below.

### Register listener

`POST /hub`

#### Description

Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.

#### Behavior

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.

#### Usage Samples

Here's an example of a request for registering a listener.

##### Request

```
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
  "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
```

##### Response

```
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
  "id": "42",
  "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
  "query": ""
}
```

### Unregister listener

`DELETE /hub/{id}`

#### Description

Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..

#### Behavior

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.

#### Usage Samples

Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener.

##### Request

```
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
```

##### Response

```
204
```

### Publish Event to listener

`POST /client/listener`

#### Description

Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.

Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.

#### Behavior

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.

#### Usage Samples

Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example "EVENT TYPEâ should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
