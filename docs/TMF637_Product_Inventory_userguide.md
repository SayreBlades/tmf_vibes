# Support of polymorphism and extension patterns

Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.

Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.

The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful.

The @referred Type can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects.

The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.

The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended.

# RESOURCE MODEL

## Managed Entity and Task Resource Models

### Product resource

A product offering procured by a customer or other interested party playing a party role. A product is realized as one or more service(s) and / or resource(s).

It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list. |

| externalIdentifier | An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned by or originates in a software system different from the current system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list. |

## Notification Resource Models

5 notifications are defined for this API.

*   Product Batch Event
*   Product Attribute Value Change Event
*   Product State Change Event
*   Product Delete Event
*   Product Create Event

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

[Figure: Diagram illustrating the notification pattern. Shows a 'SpecificEvent' inheriting from a generic 'Event' which has attributes like correlationId, eventId, eventTime, eventType. 'SpecificEvent' has a relationship 'event' to 'SpecificEventPayload', which in turn has a relationship 'resourceName' to 'SpecificResource'.]

### Updates partially a Product

`PATCH /product/{id}?fields=...`

**Description**

This operation allows partial updates of a Product entity. Support of json/merge (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

**Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes**

| Non Patchable Attributes | Rule                         |

**Usage samples**

Here's an example of a request for updating a Product resource - set status to active. This example illustrates patch using application/json.

**Request**

```http
PATCH /product/g265-tf85
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Response**

```http

### Deletes a Product

`DELETE /product/{id}`

**Description**

This operation deletes a Product entity.

**Usage samples**

Here's an example of a request for delete a specific Product.

**Request**

```http
DELETE /product/3180
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Response**

```http
204
```

# API NOTIFICATIONS

For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST calls.

It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines reproduced below.

## Register listener

`POST /hub`

**Description**

Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.

**Behavior**

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.

**Usage Samples**

Here's an example of a request for registering a listener.

**Request**

```http
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
```

**Response**

```http
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
```

```json
{
  "id": "42",
  "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
  "query": ""
}
```

## Unregister listener

`DELETE /hub/{id}`

**Description**

Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..

**Behavior**

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.

**Usage Samples**

Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener.

**Request**

```http
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
```

**Response**

```http
204
```

## Publish Event to listener

`POST /client/listener`

**Description**

Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.

Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.

**Behavior**

Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.

**Usage Samples**

Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example "EVENT TYPEâ should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given notification type.

**Request**

```http
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "event": {
    "EVENT BODY"
  },
  "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
```

**Response**

```http
201
```
